# Player analytics
> A examination project for Data Engineer course.

This project implements a data pipeline where:
* Upstream processes extract data.
* DLT (Data Load Tool) is used to create a pipeline and flatten the data
* DBT (Data Build Tool) is used for data transformation and testing.
* Downstream processes visualize the data using Taipy.
